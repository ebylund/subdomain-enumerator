# Subdomain Finder

A simple commandline subdomain finder that leverages the open source tool: [Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r)
and saves the results to a file. 

## Methods Used
The main method used to find subdomains is enumeration using search engines and several DNS lookup tools.
You can also enable a brute force method that leverages another open source package: [subbrute](https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute)
